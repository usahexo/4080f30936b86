        <h1 id="5-Hands-To-Check-Back-When-In-Position"><a href="#5-Hands-To-Check-Back-When-In-Position" class="headerlink" title="5 Hands To Check-Back When In Position"></a>5 Hands To Check-Back When In Position</h1><p>Your hand might be the most important tool you have when playing poker. That’s why it’s important to understand all of the different ways that it can be played. In this article, we will discuss five hands to check-back when in position.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pocket Aces</li>
</ol>
<p>Pocket aces are always a strong hand and should be played aggressively. However, there are times when it’s best to check-back. If there is a lot of action in front of you and you don’t think you can win the pot, then it might be best to just check and see the next card.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Big Pairs</li>
</ol>
<p>Big pairs, such as queens and kings, should also be played aggressively preflop. However, there are times when it might be better to check-back. For example, if there are a lot of players still in the hand and the pot is getting big, it might be wise to just let someone else try and win it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Middle Pairs</li>
</ol>
<p>Middle pairs can be tricky hands to play. You want to play them aggressively preflop, but you also don’t want to lose all your money if they get counterfeited. So, sometimes it’s best just to check-back and see the next card. Especially if there are lots of players still in the hand and the pot is getting big.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Weak Hands</li>
</ol>
<p>Weak hands should always be checked back when in position. There is no point in trying to play these hands out of position because you will almost always lose. Just wait until you get into position and then try and steal the pot with a bet or raise.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Suited Connectors/One Gappers/Two Gapters</li>
</ol>
<p>These types of hands should always be played cautiously preflop, especially if there are lots of players still in the hand. You don’t want to lose too much money if one of these cards gets counterfeited on the flop or turn. So, often it’s best just to check-back and see what happens on the next card</p>
<h1 id="What-To-Do-When-You-Have-A-Weak-Hand"><a href="#What-To-Do-When-You-Have-A-Weak-Hand" class="headerlink" title="What To Do When You Have A Weak Hand"></a>What To Do When You Have A Weak Hand</h1><p>In poker, having a weak hand is never ideal. However, there are still things you can do to try and improve your position and give yourself the best chance to win the hand.</p>
<p>One thing you can do when you have a weak hand is to change your playing style. If you usually play aggressive, try being more passive instead. This will help to avoid putting too much money in the pot when you don’t have a strong hand.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do is to try and make a good hand out of your weak hand. For example, if you are holding two unsuited low cards, try and make a straight or a flush. If there are lots of possible straights or flushes on the board, then go ahead and bet - even if your cards aren’t the best. You may surprise your opponents with this strategy.</p>
<p>If all else fails, remember that it’s not always necessary to win the pot in order to make money playing poker. Sometimes it’s better to fold a weak hand and wait for a better opportunity. There’s no shame in folding - it’s part of the game!</p>
<h1 id="Position-Matters-5-Hands-To-Check-Back"><a href="#Position-Matters-5-Hands-To-Check-Back" class="headerlink" title="Position Matters: 5 Hands To Check-Back"></a>Position Matters: 5 Hands To Check-Back</h1><p>In any given poker hand, the decision of when to fold, call or raise can be the defining moment of success or failure. With so many factors to consider and possibilities to balance, making the right choice at the right time is key. However, just as important as what to do is when to do it.</p>
<p>Players often make the mistake of waiting too long to act, especially in no-limit games. By definition, no-limit gives players the freedom to bet any amount up to their entire stack at any point in the hand. This makes folding much more difficult, as there is a greater potential for costly mistakes if players wait too long to make a decision.</p>
<p>To help avoid this pitfall and improve your chances for success, here is a list of five hands where it’s usually best to check-back:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pocket Pairs</p>
</li>
<li><p>3rd Street (preflop) raiser in unraised pot</p>
</li>
<li><p>Suited Connectors postflop versus one opponent</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ace-high postflop versus two opponents</p>
</li>
<li><p>Low pocket pairs (below Jacks) preflop</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-To-Play-These-Five-Hands"><a href="#How-To-Play-These-Five-Hands" class="headerlink" title="How To Play These Five Hands"></a>How To Play These Five Hands</h1><p>In poker, there are a number of different hands that players can be dealt. While some hands are stronger than others, all hands have the potential to win if played correctly. In this article, we will take a look at how to play five different hands.</p>
<h1 id="The-Best-Starting-Hand-in-Poker"><a href="#The-Best-Starting-Hand-in-Poker" class="headerlink" title="The Best Starting Hand in Poker"></a>The Best Starting Hand in Poker</h1><p>The best starting hand in poker is a royal flush. A royal flush is made up of the five highest ranking cards in the deck, all of the same suit. This hand is unbeatable, and therefore should always be played betting big and raising as much as possible.</p>
<h1 id="The-Second-Best-Hand-in-Poker"><a href="#The-Second-Best-Hand-in-Poker" class="headerlink" title="The Second Best Hand in Poker"></a>The Second Best Hand in Poker</h1><p>The second best hand in poker is a straight flush. A straight flush is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit. While this hand is not as strong as a royal flush, it is still very powerful and should be played aggressively.</p>
<h1 id="Three-Of-A-Kind"><a href="#Three-Of-A-Kind" class="headerlink" title="Three Of A Kind"></a>Three Of A Kind</h1><p>A three of a kind is made up of three cards of the same rank and two other unmatched cards. This hand can be quite powerful if played correctly and should be bet aggressively preflop. However, care should be taken not to invest too much money into this hand if there are better options available.</p>
<h1 id="Two-Pair"><a href="#Two-Pair" class="headerlink" title="Two Pair"></a>Two Pair</h1><p>A two pair consists of two cards of the same rank and two other unmatched cards. This hand can also be quite powerful but should not be invested too heavily into preflop unless there are very few better options available. It is important to remember that when playing two pair hands, the rank of the two pairs always matters more than the individual card ranks. For example, two pair AAxx would beat two pair KKxx hands every time.</p>
<h1 id="One-Pair"><a href="#One-Pair" class="headerlink" title="One Pair"></a>One Pair</h1><p>A one pair hand consists of one card of the same rank and three unmatched cards. This hand is usually not very strong and should only be played if there are few better options available.</p>
<h1 id="Why-You-Should-Check-Back-These-Hands"><a href="#Why-You-Should-Check-Back-These-Hands" class="headerlink" title="Why You Should Check-Back These Hands"></a>Why You Should Check-Back These Hands</h1><p>In poker, there are different betting rounds in which a player has the opportunity to put money into the pot. The most common betting rounds are the preflop, flop, turn and river. When it comes to postflop play, there is one particular type of hand that you should always be aware of - the check-back hand.</p>
<p>A check-back hand is a hand that you continuation bet on the flop, but then check back on the turn and river. A lot of players make the mistake of folding these hands postflop, but they can often be very profitable if played correctly.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why you should continuation bet on the flop with these hands, even if there is a danger of being check-raised. Firstly, by continuation betting you are putting more money into the pot and making it more expensive for your opponent to try and bluff you out later on. Secondly, by checking back on the turn and river you may induce your opponent to bet when they shouldn’t, leading to them making costly mistakes.</p>
<p>Finally, even if your opponent does manage to bluff you out on one of these streets, it’s not necessarily a bad thing. After all, you were only going to lose a small amount of money by folding this hand - whereas if you had called all the way through you would have lost a lot more. As such, it’s often worth taking a chance with these hands in order to increase your chances of winning pots when your hole cards aren’t particularly strong.</p>
<p>So next time you find yourself in a situation where you have a weak hold but still want to continue playing, don’t be afraid to fire off a continuation bet on the flop - even if there’s a risk of being check-raised. By doing so, you’ll be putting more money into the pot and giving yourself a better chance of winning in the long run.</p>
