#  Juventus and Napoli battle for title, while Inter and Roma fight relegation

After a very exciting season in Serie A, the final few rounds are now upon us and things are starting to take shape. Juventus have opened up a three-point lead at the top of the table and look set to win their eighth consecutive title, but Napoli are hot on their heels and will do everything they can to prevent that from happening.

Meanwhile, Inter and Roma are embroiled in a battle to avoid relegation. The former sit just two points above the drop zone, while the latter are four points clear but have played a game more. Anything could still happen in this part of the table, so both teams will be giving it their all until the end of the season.

Here is a closer look at how things stand in each of these three races:

1. Juventus vs Napoli – Title Race

It is Juventus who currently hold pole position in the title race, with a three-point lead over Napoli. The Turin side have been absolutely dominant this season, losing just two games so far. They have been especially strong at home, where they have won all but one of their fixtures.

Napoli, on the other hand, have been excellent away from home but have been less consistent at home. They did manage to record a 2-0 win over Juventus in December, but overall Juve have been the better team this season. With just a handful of games left to play, it looks like they will eventually be crowned champions once again.

2. Inter vs Roma – Relegation Battle

This is undoubtedly the most closely contested race in Serie A at the moment, with just two points separating Inter and Roma. The former have been inconsistent all season long, while the latter have alternated between good and bad performances.

Inter do appear to be favourites to stay up given that they have two games in hand, but anything could still happen between these two teams. Fans of both clubs will be hoping for a decisive result when they meet in Rome on May 13th.

#  Players like Dybala and Mertens lead the top scorers table

Dybala and Mertens are two players that have impressed this season. They lead the top scorers table with 19 goals each.

Dybala has had a fantastic season with Juventus. He has been one of their main attacking threats. His link-up play with Mandzukic and Ronaldo has been superb. He always looks to get into dangerous positions in the final third. Mertens has also had a great season for Napoli. He has scored some important goals, including some crucial ones in the Champions League.

Both Dybala and Mertens are very talented players with plenty of skill and trickery. They are both capable of scoring goals from all sorts of angles and distances. They have both been in superb form this season and will be looking to continue this in the latter stages of the season.

#  Teams like Chievo and Benevento struggling at the foot of the table

In the early stages of the 2017/2018 season, a few teams have found themselves battling against relegation. At the foot of the table are Chievo and Benevento, who have both collected only 3 points from their first 10 games.

Chievo, in particualr, are in a difficult situation. They have not won a game all season and have only scored 6 goals. This is in stark contrast to their form last year, when they finished in 9th place and scored 50 goals. Their poor form has seen them fire 3 managers so far this season.

Benevento, on the other hand, are a newly-promoted side and were always going to find it difficult at this level. However, their 3 points from 10 games is still disappointing. They have conceded 24 goals so far and only scored 8.

These two sides will need to start picking up points soon if they want to avoid relegation.

#  Fans witness exciting matches every week

The Premier League never fails to provide excitement and drama for football fans all over the world. Every week, viewers are treated to some of the best football that can be found, with top players competing against each other. Attacking football is the norm in the Premier League, and this often leads to very exciting matches.

One of the reasons for the excitement in the Premier League is the huge variety of talented players who are on display every week. From Harry Kane and Dele Alli at Tottenham Hotspur to Sergio Aguero at Manchester City, there is no shortage of world-class talent in this league.

The fact that even the smaller clubs can cause an upset adds to the thrill of watching Premier League games.

#  Who will be crowned champion at the end of the season?

The NFL season is heating up, and the race to the Super Bowl is in full swing. There are a number of teams that have a shot at winning the title, but only one can be crowned champion at the end of the season. Here is a look at the contenders for the Super Bowl this year.

The New England Patriots are always contenders, and they are looking like one of the strongest teams this year. They have an explosive offense and a tough defense, and they are looking like a team that could go all the way.

The Dallas Cowboys are also contenders this year. They have an impressive offense led by Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott, and their defense is steadily improving. If they can stay healthy, they could make a deep run in the playoffs.

The Pittsburgh Steelers are another team with Super Bowl potential. They have one of the best offenses in the league, and their defense is solid as well. With Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown leading the charge, the Steelers could be headed for another championship.

The Atlanta Falcons were one win away from winning the Super Bowl last year, and they will be looking to take home the title this year. They have an explosive offense led by Matt Ryan and Julio Jones, and their defense is improving every week. If they can keep up their current pace, they will be tough to beat in the playoffs.

The Green Bay Packers are always contenders in the NFC, and this year is no exception. Aaron Rodgers is playing some of his best football ever, and with Jordy Nelson back on offence, the Packers have a lot of firepower. Their defence has been shaky at times this year, but if they can improve down the stretch they could make a run at another Super Bowl title.
