#  Leap Gaming launches new overhead camera that monitors player and dealer behaviour

Leap Gaming has announced the launch of a new overhead camera system that will monitor the behaviour of both players and dealers in real-time. The aim of the system is to help prevent collusion and cheating in land-based casinos.

The new system comprises of two overhead cameras, one positioned above each table, which constantly record the actions of all players and dealers. These recordings are then analysed by a team of experts who look for any suspicious behaviour that could indicate collusion or cheating.

In addition to monitoring player and dealer behaviour, the new system also monitors table activity, including betting patterns and hand movements. This information is used to create a ‘heatmap’ that highlights any abnormal activity that could indicate possible collusion or cheating.

“The launch of our new overhead camera system is another step forward in our mission to protect casinos against collusion and cheating,” said Leap Gaming CEO, Eitan Beth-Halachmy. “The system provides casinos with an additional layer of security that helps ensure the integrity of their games.”

Leap Gaming is already well known for its pioneering work in anti-collusion technology. The company’s suite of products includes software that analyses player and dealer behaviour, as well as table activity, in order to identify any suspicious activity.
