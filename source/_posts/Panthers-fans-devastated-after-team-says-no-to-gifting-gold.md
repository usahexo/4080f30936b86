#  Panthers say no to gifting gold, fans react

Some fans are reacting to the news with disappointment, while others are praising the team for making a savvy business decision. "

It makes perfect sense that the Panthers wouldn't give away their remaining gold," says one fan. "They're a business, and they need to protect their assets."

Others are worried that this decision will further alienate fans who are already disappointed about the team's lackluster performance in the Super Bowl. "This just feels like another slap in the face," says one fan. "I'm not sure I want to support this team anymore."

#  NFL denies Panthers fans ability to gift each other gold

To Panthers fans, it was a way of honoring their team in its first Super Bowl appearance: giving each other small pieces of gold jewelry. But to the NFL, it was an unapproved use of league trademarks.

The Panthers reached the Super Bowl after posting a 15-1 regular-season record. And some of their fans came up with a way to show their support for the team before the Feb. 7 game against the Broncos: gold jewelry in the shape of the team's logo.

But NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Wednesday that the league has denied requests from some fans in Charlotte to wear or give such jewelry at Sunday's game.

"It is not approved," McCarthy wrote in an email. "They can wear blue and silver."

NFL rules prohibit using team trademarks on unapproved items, and the Panthers' logo is no exception. Charlotte-based jeweler Justin Thorp created the logo­-shaped pieces of gold, which he calls "Super Bowl L" necklaces, and began offering them for sale at his shop last week. He said he had sold about 200 necklaces at $250 apiece by Wednesday morning.

Some fans who had ordered them were disappointed when they learned they couldn't wear them at the game.

Mike Kuczkowski, a 44-year-old sales representative from Fort Mill, South Carolina, said he bought two necklaces for himself and his girlfriend as a way to show how much he loves the Panthers. He called the NFL's decision "a letdown."

"It's kind of a slap in the face to all Panthers fans," Kuczkowski said.
